# Security Configuration for Loan Assistance Tool Backend

## Current Security Implementations

### Input Validation
- Phone number validation with minimum length requirement
- Email format validation  
- PAN and Aadhaar format validation
- CIBIL score range validation
- Student ID format validation (alphanumeric with limited special chars)
- Document type validation against whitelist
- File name validation with path traversal protection
- File extension validation for uploads

### Environment Variable Security
- Required environment variables validation on startup
- Warning for missing optional variables
- Safe AWS credentials handling with fallback

### API Security
- Input sanitization for all user inputs
- S3 pre-signed URL generation with validation
- Error message sanitization to prevent information disclosure
- MongoDB query parameter validation

### File Upload Security
- Restricted file extensions (.pdf, .doc, .docx, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .txt)
- File name sanitization to prevent path traversal
- Document type validation against allowed types
- Safe S3 key generation

## Recommended Additional Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- JWT token authentication for all endpoints
- Role-based access control
- API rate limiting
- Session management

### HTTPS & Transport Security
- Force HTTPS in production
- HSTS headers
- Secure cookie settings

### Additional Headers
- CSP (Content Security Policy)
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-XSS-Protection

### Database Security
- MongoDB connection encryption
- Input sanitization for NoSQL injection prevention
- Database user with minimal required permissions

### Logging & Monitoring
- Security event logging
- Failed authentication attempt monitoring
- Unusual activity detection
- Log sanitization to prevent log injection

### Production Considerations
- WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- DDoS protection
- Regular security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
